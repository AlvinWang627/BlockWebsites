You can use the Block Websites Chrome extension to combat website addiction.

Block Websites is open-source on GitHub, featuring a simple UI, easy operation, and security.

You only need to set up two things:

1. A redirect URL (default: www.google.com)

2. The websites you want to block (multiple sites can be added).

Once set up, any attempt to visit a blocked website will automatically redirect to the redirect URL.

Everything is fully customizable by the user.
